## Getting Started

Fill up env for FTP server:

APP_FTP_LOGIN,
APP_FTP_PASSWORD,
APP_FTP_PORT,
APP_FTP_PATH,
APP_FTP_PATH_TEST``

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Run `docker compose build --pull --no-cache` to build fresh images
3. Run `docker compose up` (the logs will be displayed in the current shell)
4. Open `https://localhost` in your favorite web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334)
5. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.
6. Run `docker exec -ti container_name sh` to go into container
7. Dir `var/images` is mounted move there some pictures to resize
8. Run command `bin/console image:resize path/to/img width hight server`. For now FTP supported. You can use option `--seve-local` to store resized img on local directory `var/resized`
